            <h1>New York State Route 373 (NY 373)</h1>
            <p id="1"> <strong>New York State Route 373 (NY 373)</strong> is is a short state highway <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex_County,_New_York"> Essex County, New York</a>,
                within <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adirondack_Park">Park.</a> It begins at <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_9_in_New_York">Route 9</a> (US 9) and proceeds
                eastward,
                ending at a ferry landing on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Champlain">Lake Champlain</a>.
                It
                intersects two county routes, several local roads, and a<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_reference_routes_in_New_York"> reference
                    route</a>—NY912T—which connects it with US 9. NY 373 is the only connector between US 9 and the
                hamlet
                of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Kent,_New_York"> Kent</a> and the ferry that serves it.
            </p>
            <p>The hamlet of Port Kent and the connecting road were originally built in 1823. The village was planned to
                act
                as a source of labor for iron manufacturing and to provide for the industrial needs of Essex County. The
                hamlet grew and eventually became connected to <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_Vermont">Burlington,Vermont</a> , via an hour-long
                ferry
                across Lake
                Champlain. The road that accessed Port Kent originally began in Keeseville, but became part of the
                longer<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Kent_and_Hopkinton_Turnpike">
                    Port Kent and Hopkinton Turnpike</a> in the 1830s. The highway that is now NY 373 was also
                designated as
                part of
                the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway in 1919.</p>
            <p>When NY 373 was designated in 1930, a small portion of it was maintained by the town of<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt_International_Highway"> Chesterfield</a>.
                This
                section was turned over to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)"> State of New
                    York</a>
                during a maintenance swap with Essex County in 1985.

            <p id="2">
                NY 373, located entirely within Adirondack Park, begins at <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_9_in_New_York">US9</a> at the <a

                    Chesterfield</a>. The route intersects with NY 912T, its southern connector to US 9,
                about 0.1 miles (160 m) in. NY 373 continues farther along and intersects with <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Route_71_(Essex_County,_New_York)">County Route 71</a>
                (CR 71)
                before heading east-southeast just north of the <a

                intersects <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Route_17_(Essex_County,_New_York)">CR 17</a>
                and
                several local roads, and then turns east-northeast.<sup>[3]</sup>
                The route then passes south of a golf course and enters <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Kent,_New_York">Port Kent</a>, where it intersects with
                more local
                streets, most of which serve homes and businesses. The highway turns northward soon afterward, crosses a
                pair of train tracks maintained by <a

                U-turn and comes to an end at the <a
