            <p id="1"> <strong>New York State Route 373 (NY 373)</strong> is is a short state highway <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex_County,_New_York"> Essex County, New York</a>,
                within <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adirondack_Park">Adirondack Park.</a> It begins at <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_9_in_New_York">U.S Route 9</a> (US 9) and proceeds
                eastward,
                ending at a ferry landing on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Champlain">Lake Champlain</a>.
                It
                intersects two county routes, several local roads, and a<a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_reference_routes_in_New_York"> reference
                    route</a>—NY912T—which connects it with US 9. NY 373 is the only connector between US 9 and the
                hamlet
                of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Kent,_New_York"> Kent</a> and the ferry that serves it.
            </p>
            <p>The hamlet of Port Kent and the connecting road were originally built in 1823. The village was planned to
                act
                as a source of labor for iron manufacturing and to provide for the industrial needs of Essex County. The
                hamlet grew and eventually became connected to <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_Vermont">Burlington,Vermont</a> , via an hour-long
                ferry
                across Lake
                Champlain. The road that accessed Port Kent originally began in Keeseville, but became part of the
                longer<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Kent_and_Hopkinton_Turnpike">
                    Port Kent and Hopkinton Turnpike</a> in the 1830s. The highway that is now NY 373 was also
                designated as
                part of
                the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt_International_Highway">Theodore Roosevelt
                    International Highway</a> in 1919.</p>
            <p>When NY 373 was designated in 1930, a small portion of it was maintained by the town of<a

                <h2>Port Kent and the early highway to Keeseville</h2>
                <p id="4">In 1823, a company was funded to establish a settlement and fishing wharf opposite the city
                    of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_Vermont">Burlington,Vermont</a> on Lake
                    Champlain in order to assist in the growth of <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_iron_and_steel_industry_in_the_United_States#Early_republic">iron
                        factories</a>and to
                    supply dormant energy to the Essex County area. The newly founded company chose the name "Port Kent"
                    and located the new hamlet on a site north of Trembleau Point. The original alignment of what is now
                    NY 373 began as a wide road that was built to access Port Kent from the nearby village of
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeseville,_New_York">Keeseville</a>.<sup>[5]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    NY 373 exists entirely within the boundaries of <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adirondack_Park">Adirondack Park.</a>, a protected area
                    maintained by the
                    State of New York. Adirondack Park was created in the 1880s after concerns arose about logging trees
                    in the area. The logging was a substantial part of New York's economy, but protests were lodged by
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times">The New York Times</a> and others against
                    the clearing of entire mountains and wilderness areas of
                    trees. Public opinion turned firmly against the loggers by the 1880s, and the park was created in
                    1885. It was the first State Forest Preserve in America. The park was further protected in 1894 when
                    a clause was added to the <a

                <h2>Old roads and designation</h2>
                <p id="5">On April 16, 1827, a team of three surveyors were commissioned to determine a routing for a
                    new highway leading from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopkinton,_New_York">Hopkinton</a>,
                    a town in northeastern <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Lawrence_County,_New_York">St.Lawrence County</a>, to
                    Lake
                    Champlain.<sup>[9]</sup> The task took 26 days, after which it was determined that the highway would
                    meet Lake
                    Champlain at Fort Kent.<sup>[10]]</sup> An act authorizing the construction of the highway was
                    passed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52nd_New_York_State_Legislature">New York State
                        Legislature</a> on April 18, 1829. A total of approximately $38,500<sup>[11]</sup>
                    (equivalent to
                    $935,670 in 2022)<sup>[12]</sup> was devoted to the project by the state of New York through the
                    same act.<sup>[11]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>The 75-mile (121 km) highway opened in 1833 as a

                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll_road">toll road</a> named the Port Kent and
                        Hopkinton
                        Turnpike.[9] The turnpike had only one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll_gate">toll
                            gate</a>, located near the center of the route. Two
                        years
                        later, the turnpike commissioners petitioned to the state of New York, asking for permission to
                        replace the single gate with two gates at opposite ends of the turnpike that would collect half
                        of
                        the toll amount. The commissioners believed that the change in the toll gate locations would
                        result
                        in higher revenue, allowing them to continue maintaining the highway.<sup>[13]</sup>The change
                        was
                        approved;<sup>[14][15]</sup> however, the toll road was dissolved anyway three years later on
                        March
                        30, 1838.
                        At that time, maintenance of the Port Kent–Hopkinton highway was transferred to the towns
                        through
                        which it ran.<sup>[16]</sup>

                <p> The state of New York assumed maintenance of most of the Ausable Chasm–Port Kent roadway at some
                    point after 1920.<sup>[19]</sup> In the <a

                    of the

                    despite the
                    fact that the small portion of the route east of Lake Street in Port Kent was not maintained by the
                    state at the time.<sup>[20]</sup> On April 1, 1985, ownership and maintenance of NY 373 east of Lake
