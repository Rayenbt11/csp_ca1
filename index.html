        <h1>New York State Route 373 (NY 373)</h1>
        <p id="1"> <strong>New York State Route 373 (NY 373)</strong> is is a short state highway <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex_County,_New_York"> Essex County, New York</a>,
            within <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adirondack_Park">Park.</a> It begins at <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_9_in_New_York">Route 9</a> (US 9) and proceeds eastward,
            ending at a ferry landing on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Champlain">Lake Champlain</a>. It
            intersects two county routes, several local roads, and a<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_reference_routes_in_New_York"> reference
                route</a>—NY912T—which connects it with US 9. NY 373 is the only connector between US 9 and the hamlet
            of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Kent,_New_York"> Kent</a> and the ferry that serves it.
        </p>
        <p>The hamlet of Port Kent and the connecting road were originally built in 1823. The village was planned to act
            as a source of labor for iron manufacturing and to provide for the industrial needs of Essex County. The
            hamlet grew and eventually became connected to <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_Vermont">Burlington</a> Vermont, via an hour-long ferry
            across Lake
            Champlain. The road that accessed Port Kent originally began in Keeseville, but became part of the longer<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Kent_and_Hopkinton_Turnpike">
                Port Kent and Hopkinton Turnpike</a> in the 1830s. The highway that is now NY 373 was also designated as
            part of
            the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway in 1919.</p>
        <p>When NY 373 was designated in 1930, a small portion of it was maintained by the town of<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt_International_Highway"> Chesterfield</a>. This
            section was turned over to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)"> State of New York</a>
            during a maintenance swap with Essex County in 1985.
